## 🔐 QWERTY-Based Message Encryption for Banking System

This Java class provides a simple encryption and hashing mechanism tailored for obfuscating sensitive messages in banking applications. It uses a rotated QWERTY layout for character substitution and supports optional dual-key encryption after 8 characters. It also provides a SHA-256 hash for integrity.

---

## 🧰 Features
- QWERTY-based encryption using a user-defined starting letter
- Dual-key mapping for added complexity
- SHA-256 hashing of encrypted messages
- Decryption using reverse-mapped keys
- Console-based user interaction

---

## 📂 File Structure
- `QwertyEncryption.java`: Main source file containing all logic

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Compile the code**:
```bash
javac QwertyEncryption.java
```
2. **Run the application**:
```bash
java QwertyEncryption
```
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Choose to encrypt or decrypt
   - Enter your message
   - Provide the first starting letter
   - (Optional) Enter a second starting letter if your message is long enough

---

## 📄 Sample
```
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt a message? E
Enter the message to encrypt: SecureLogin
Enter the first starting letter: Q
Enter the second starting letter for characters after the 8th: M
Encrypted Message: WTAKILFZTGX
SHA-256 Hashed Encrypted Message: 14c868ec... (64-char hash)
```

## ⚠️ Notes
- This works properly only upto 16 digits.
- This is not a cryptographically secure cipher.
- Suitable for obfuscation and educational projects.
- Do not use for storing real passwords.
